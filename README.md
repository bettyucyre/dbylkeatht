# How to Get Unbanned on Dead by Daylight (2025 Guide) 🎭

Getting banned from Dead by Daylight can be a total nightmare, especially if you’re pretty sure you didn’t do anything shady. This handy guide will walk you through what to do if you’ve been banned and how to appeal like a pro to get your account back in the fog.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did you get banned immediately after making a fresh account or does that ban follow you to every new survivor or killer you create? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! That means Dead by Daylight has fingerprinted your PC’s hardware, making it tricky to join matches even with brand-new accounts.
